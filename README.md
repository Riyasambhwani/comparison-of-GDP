# comparison-of-GDP

I have build this project to analyze how Life Expectancy in years (health) and GDP per capita (wealth) have changed from 1952-2007 in the world for various countries.

Using bubble plot of different theme in python, we can visualize how population, life expectancy and GDP has changed. We can also compare them of different countries through strip chart.

By this visualization we are able to analyse that how the continents grow in 55 years economically growth, education development, health welfare as well as population growth.
